  image: FaaSNet.jpg
  description: "FaaSNet is a highly-scalable middleware
system for accelerating FaaS container provisioning. FaaSNet is
driven by the workload and infrastructure requirements of the FaaS
platform at one of the worldâ€™s largest cloud providers, Alibaba Cloud
Function Compute. FaaSNet enables scalable container provisioning via
a lightweight, adaptive function tree (FT) structure. FaaSNet uses an
I/O efficient, on-demand fetching mechanism to further reduce
provisioning costs at scale. We have implemented and integrated
FaaSNet in Alibaba Cloud Function Compute. "

- title: "Wukong: A Scalable and Locality-Enhanced Framework for Serverless Parallel Computing"
  image: wukong.png
  description: "Our new serverless parallel framework, Wukong,
takes a new serverless scheduling approach. This new approach, called
decentralized scheduling, enables scheduling to be distributed across
Lambda executors that can schedule tasks in parallel, and brings
multiple benefits, including enhanced data locality, reduced network
I/Os, automatic resource elasticity, and improved cost effectiveness.
We show that, on AWS Lambda, Wukong achieves near-ideal scalability,
executes parallel computation jobs up to 68.17x faster, reduces
network I/O by multiple orders of magnitude, and achieves 92.96%
tenant-side cost savings compared to the state-of-the-art."

divides clients into tiers based on their training performance and
selects clients from the same tier in each training round to mitigate
the straggler problem caused by heterogeneity in resource anddata
quantity. To further tame the heterogeneity caused by non-IID
(Independent and Identical Distribution) data and resources, TiFL
employs an adaptive tier selection approach to update the tiering
on-the-fly based on the observed training performance and accuracy. "

in-memory object caching system that is completely built and deployed
atop ephemeral serverless functions.  InfiniCache exploits and

intelligent billed duration control, and an efficient data backup
mechanism to maximize data availability and cost effectiveness while
balancing the risk of losing cached state and performance."
