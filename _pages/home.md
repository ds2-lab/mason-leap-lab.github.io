<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star" aria-hidden="true"></span> <font face="Palatino Linotype">"Leap" can be an acronym formed from the initials of many meaningful verbs in the context of experimental computer systems domain, for example:<br />
<em>L: to Learn, E: to Enable, A: to Accelerate, P: to Propel.</em></font>
<!--A research team whose goal is to <strong>p</strong>ropel computer systems techniques and <strong>e</strong>nhancements with insights learned through experiments and practical
deployments.</font-->

We are a research team of [Computer Science](https://cs.gmu.edu) at [George Mason University](https://gmu.edu). 
Our aim is to explore and build better systems software to sustain
the requirements of next-generation applications.

We are interested in addressing challenges existing in
real-world distributed and storage systems.  Our research is driven
by the complexities of modern data-intensive computer systems, and
the need for more efficient and flexible approaches to manage such
complexities. We aim for innovation in systems technologies that
range from large-scale distributed systems to cross-layer
software-hardware co-design.   

**We are committed to training the next-gen of systems researchers and
developers.** We are seeking Ph.D. students who are passionate about
solving practical challenging problems in modern datacenter
applications & systems. We are also open to working with Masters and
undergrad students. Taking my grad systems classes (CS 795/675) is a good
way to know more about relevant research in the fields.
